# Combined Cycle Power Plant- Energy Forecasting Model
## Objective
The primary goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts energy output for a Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). By leveraging environmental factors such as temperature, ambient pressure, exhaust vacuum, and relative humidity, the model aims to optimize energy management and improve operational efficiency in energy production.

## Key Features
The model relies on the following environmental factors that directly affect energy production:

- Temperature: Fluctuations in ambient temperature can significantly impact energy efficiency and production rates.
- Ambient Pressure: Atmospheric pressure influences the operational environment of the power plant systems.
- Exhaust Vacuum: Proper vacuum levels in exhaust systems are essential for maintaining energy output efficiency.
- Relative Humidity: The amount of moisture in the air can alter energy production efficiency, especially in systems sensitive to air density.
## Data Analysis
To understand the underlying relationships between the features and energy output, thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted:

- Visualizations like scatter plots and correlation matrices were used to identify patterns.
- Potential outliers were detected and managed to avoid skewing the model’s performance.
- Feature importance was assessed to determine which variables had the most significant impact on energy production.
## Regression Techniques Applied
Several regression techniques were explored to build the most robust and accurate model:

- Linear Regression: A simple approach to capture the linear relationships between input variables and energy production.
- Regularization Techniques:
Elastic Net was employed to balance between Ridge and Lasso regularization, preventing overfitting while maintaining model interpretability.
- Ensemble Methods:
Random Forest: Utilized multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy through averaging.
XGBoost: Leveraged gradient boosting to optimize performance and achieve better results by minimizing prediction errors iteratively.
## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the model’s performance, the following metrics were used:

- R-squared (R²): Measured the proportion of variance in energy production explained by the input features, reflecting the model’s ability to fit the data.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Provided insights into the average squared differences between actual and predicted values, helping quantify prediction accuracy.
## Model Performance
After extensive experimentation, the final model, powered by XGBoost, demonstrated an exceptional accuracy of 96%. This level of precision underscores the model’s ability to reliably predict energy production based on the environmental factors.

## Conclusion
The developed model highlights the critical role environmental conditions play in energy production, offering valuable insights for optimizing power plant operations. By accurately forecasting energy output, this tool empowers stakeholders in the energy sector to make data-driven decisions, ultimately enhancing energy efficiency and management. With further fine-tuning and adjustments, the model’s robustness can be enhanced, making it a valuable asset for long-term energy forecasting and optimization
